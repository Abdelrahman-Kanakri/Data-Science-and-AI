Here is how to view each file.

there is around 5 files:
  - 6Final_report file.
  - Imdb_raw.csv file which is the data I have worked on.
  - Cleaned_Data.csv file which is the preprocessed data I used in my dashboard and datafolio phase.
  - imdb-top-1000-movies.ipynb python file where the work is.
  - Dashboard & Datafolio where you will need to see in order to get a quick view on the project


So to able to see the Final_report, Dashboard & Datafolio files just download it.
